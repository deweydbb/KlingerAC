                    This project began with a conversation I had with my dad about
                    the useless compressor usage graph provided by his relatively
                    new AC unit. It only showed him whether the compressor was on
                    or off, not what percentage the compressor was running at. I
                    casually mentioned that it wouldn't be that difficult to setup
                    a simple web scraper to get the compressor percentage every fifteen
                    minutes, store it in a database, and create some graphs from
                    that data. Well turns out it was a little more difficult than
                    that because MyNexia does not display compressor percentage on
                    their web portal. They did however, display the percentage on
                    their android app. So one decompressed apk later and a few hours
                    of reverse engineering their api calls, I was able to programmatically
                    get the compressor percentage with an http call.

                    This project is powered completely by the Google Cloud Platform.
                    I have one Google Cloud Function that queries the current compressor
                    percentage and outdoor temperature every fifteen minutes. That data
                    is then stored in the Firebase nosql database Firestore. This website
                    is being hosted using Firebase Hosting.
